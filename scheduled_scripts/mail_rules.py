# Title: mail_rules
# Date:  2020-05-18 | 2020-08-14 rev2
# Author:  Ethan Mooney
# Description:  This program continuously runs the save_attach function under a while true statement. save_attach() looks
# for the specified attachment (arg) in all emails received in the past 4 hours.  If it finds the attachment, it saves a copy
# of the attachment to the specified location (arg) under the specified name (arg).  After completing the function the while
# true loop sleeps for 20 minutes.
